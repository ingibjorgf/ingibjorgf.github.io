              <div class="titleall"> Í Iðrum / Underground </div>
              <p> Reconstructing a piano and controlling the playing of strings with Arduino micro controller and Solenoid motors to perform a composition using data from the earthquakes  of the Bardabunga volcano in 2014.
              </p>
              <p>It is established practice to put data into music to gain deeper understanding of the information. The composition Underground is built on this tradition. It is comprised of two independent, yet complimentary components. The physical aspect of an old, rusty, upright piano that has been transformed into a new instrument and simultaneously a music composition based on data from the Icelandic Meteorological Office about earthquakes in Bardabunga volcano from 08/29/2014 - 09/01/2014. These are the first four days before Bardabunga erupted, rewritten into a 20 minute composition. The bigger the earthquake the deeper the string on the instrument in played. The earthquakes grow as the eruption comes closer. The quakes turn out to be very musical and very unpredictable.
The instrument is built on an old upright piano. A part of the hammer mechanism, the jack, was reused to build new hammers that play the strings. These new hammers are controlled with small motors, solenoids, and hammer straight on the strings.
 </p>
              <p>The piano was tuned to a new scale, the lower strings are very loose and represent the deep shakes of an earthquake, the subwoofer is also meant to underline the quake effects with deep base tones that “shake” the audience.
            </p>
            <p>Positioned around the instrument in the room are four speakers and a subwoofer. A microphone captures the sound of the instrument and broadcasts it to the speakers in real time. Additionally, effects are applied to the sound in real time. Listeners are asked to walk around the space while the piece is performed.</p>

This composition is an experiment to use the Moog as the only sound-source for a composition and record it using an ADAT 8-track digital recorder. No post mixing or mastering was done to this recording. This medium disallowing any editing after initial recording makes for a unique and interesting challenge. </p>

      <p>The Flight to Halmstad is a composition for two typewriters, a storyteller, flute, clarinet, horn and ebows on a piano. The centre of the composition is exploring the sound possibilities of typewriters as instruments and as notation writers for the other instruments. The composition is based on a short story by Gyrðir Elíasson, The Flight to Halmstad, translated by Victoria Cribb.
</p>
      <p>In The Flight to Halmstad the typewriter is an instrument, equally as valuable as the other performers playing traditional instruments. The typewriter score is written in traditional- classical notation, challenging the ability of that system to write for unconventional instruments. Writing for a typewriter in the traditional notation system is challenging as it is not a conventional instrument, new specific graphics are necessary in the score to write out the sounds coming from the typewriter.
</p>
  <p>The traditional notation that the two typewriters play generate a text score for the trio to improvise off of. In this composition the text scores are very open. They are short sentences from the short story Flight to Halmstad. These texts inspire and are meant to stimulate the performer, structuring  their improvisations. The piece is structured such that for each sentence of the short story, the typewriter outputs the sentence in various forms onto the page by exactly following the traditional notation written for it. Following this, the traditional instruments improvise based off of this generated page. Finally the storyteller reads out the sentence.
</p>
<p>Text and graphic scores in the modern sense go back to the experiments of the New York School composers around the early 1950s.  Those scores use non-traditional symbols and text to convey information about the performance of the piece of music, often having more resemblance to abstract paintings than they do to musical scores. Early practitioners include Earle Brown, John Cage and Pauline Oliveros. ´The Flight to Halmstad´ contrasts traditional notation for unconventional instruments with unconventional notation for traditional instruments.

<div class="titleall"> Right is Wrong </div>

<p> “Right is Wrong” is a solo piano piece, written with animated notation. Every time the piece is performed, the left hand is the same but the right hand is written with real-time notation and is continually changing. The result of this is that the pianist can practice the left hand but not the right hand. The piece is supposed to challenge the idea of the perfect concert pianist that does not make mistakes. The goal is not perfection because the right hand is unpredictable and impossibly hard to play. The right hand is wrong, or Right is Wrong.

      <p>Y is an interactive chamber music piece written for four strings, three violins and a cello, and includes motion detectors that generate a real-time animated score. Each time the piece is performed, it is different depending on the movement of the audience. The audience knows that they can interfere with the notation by moving, but they do not know how these movements are changing the notation.
</p>
      <p>The score is built on traditional notation so it generates pitch on traditional five stave lines. Sometimes a rhythmic pattern is given, but sometimes only a pitch. If no rhythmic pattern is given the performer is free to improvise a free rhythm. Instead of using traditional musical terms, like allegro, it uses english adjectives for example shy, hysterical or impulsive. In the end all pitches disappear and the four string players are given instruction to glissando.
</p>
<p>The notation generates complicated harmony and difficult rhythmic counterpoint. The visible aspect of the notation is an important part of this composition as well as giving the audience part in co-composing this composition with their movements.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this piece was to explore audience participation randomising aspects of the notation.

      <p>Muschine is a duo between a pianist and a live coder. The live-coding builds a unique sound-sculpture around the piano lines. The composition explores the possibilities of incorporating improvised live coded sounds with acoustic instruments.
</p>
      <p>The live-coder is improvising and leading the composition. The live coding is on a screen seen by both pianist and the audience. The pianist is playing traditional notation, that has been split into numbered units. The live-coder controls when the pianist plays, by typing comments into the code stating what the pianist should play, for example: “Play unit 3, peacefully, three times.”  It is a conversation between the two players and their very different sound sources, an acoustic piano and electronic sound mass.  It is an exploration of using improvised computer music in classical composition.
</p>
<p>The live-coding is done in ixi lang. Ixi lang is a live coding environment and a controller for synth engines written in open source programming languages such as SuperCollider. The ixi lang score is active, it can changes in real time by writing new code. According to ixi lang´s website the aim  of the software is to: “We acknowledge the constraints that software put on the musician, the limits that the tool sets for the creative process and we therefore promote and try to disseminate technologies which open up the limits of the software (or defines new boundaries). Our belief is that it should be the artist that defines the scope of his or her instrument (and therefore music), not a commercial software company.”

      <p>Myrkraverk is a composition for a solo double bass and eight percussionists. It is written with real-time animated notation, controlled by an Arduino through software built in Pure Data. The double bass player stands in the middle while the eight percussionists sit on the floor around him. The double bass plays animated notation on a screen while in front of each percussionist is a LED light. That light is their notation, each colour of the light representing a different playing method, and their instruments are unconventional - for example banging together stones, wood and knitting needles.
</p>
      <p>The piece is performed almost in darkness, only the notation light is visible. The title is of this composition is a word play. In Icelandic “myrkur” means darkness and “verk” means a piece. These words together - Myrkraverk - means a deed of darkness.
</p>
<p>The lines played by the double bass are dark and heavy, but framed by the beautiful counterpoint of the percussionists. To begin with the percussion instruments are small sounds but they grow as the composition builds up to more aggressive sounds. The LED notation makes the complicated counterpoint played by the percussionists so easy that anyone could take part in performing this composition.

      <p>The work was premiered at Podium Festival 2012 in Selið, Stokkalæk. Stokkalækur used to be a farm but was remodelled into a music centre. The piece was performed in the old barn. The barn was filled with pillows and the kids where offered to sit on a pillow as close to the musicians as they wanted to.
</p>
<p>The intent of this composition was to get children interested in musical instruments and chamber music from an early age as well as simply creative entertainment for children.
</p>
<p>Plot:</p>
<p>The story is about a calf, Fjörkálfur, that lives on a farm. His best friends are the northern lights and he dances with them at night. A pig, Hrekkjusvín, also lives at the farm and one day he captures the Northern Lights. Fjörkálfur sets off on a journey up the glacier, where the pig is hiding, to save his friends.
