      <div id="aboutmain">
          As a composer, vocal improviser and sound-artist, Ingibjörg Friðriksdóttir, is constantly researching new techniques to explore and experiment with composition and performing music. Ingibjörg’s most recent composition explore in-depth the use of programming
          in experimental electronic music, including real-time processing and synthesis, as well as analog techniques, recording and synthesisers. Her compositions vary from acoustic, electronic, electroacoustic and multimedia. Collaboration and
          improvisation are a consistent themes of her work. Ingibjörg is currently pursuing a MFA in Electronic Music and Recording Media at Mills College. She received a BA degree in Music Composition from The Icelandic Academy of the Arts and
          a diploma from The Reykjavik Academy of Singing and Vocal Arts in 2011.

          In her acoustic works Ingibjörg has experimented with unusual notation, particularly animated. Animated notation is the practice of having computer animations and moving graphics on a computer screen be the score of a written musical work. She wrote her
          BA thesis on the opportunities and limitation of animated notation and has worked closely with leading Icelandic performers of Animated notation works, for example the composition Right is Wrong for solo piano for Tinna Þorsteinsdóttir.
          Animated notation inspired for further research programming and interactivity in music, extending the experience of the music performance with audience participation. Among interactive compositions are “Y” and “The Invisible Guitarist”,
          both using motion detectors. Extending the techniques in notation Ingibjörg composed Myrkraverk, for solo double bass and 8 percussionists, where the notation were LED lights controlled by an Arduino through a software built in Pure Data.
          In August 2015 Ingibjörg was commissioned by Cycle Art and Music Festival to exhibit the piece Í Iðrum. Í Iðrum is a new musical instrument build on an old piano, the hammers of a piano are controlled by an Arduino using earthquake data.
          This piece was elected to be one of Iceland’s contribution to the composition festival UNM, Denmark in August 2016.
